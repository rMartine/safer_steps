  DISCLAIMER : 'Did you know that a large portion of falls occur on stairs?\n\nDid you also know that we have very little information on stair-related falls and what may have caused them?\n\nFor these reasons, we have built the “Safer Steps” app for users to identify stairs and stair features in their environment and report on any falls that may have occurred.\n\nIn this pilot study, we are looking for people who would be willing to try our “Safer Steps” app and participate in a focus group session about the app goals and features in order to improve the app for future users. App use will take a maximum of 15 minutes and focus groups will range in time from 40-60 minutes. For a total of approximately one hour and fifteen minutes of your time.\n\nIf you are 18 years or older and have no medical condition that would be a barrier to the use of a cellphone based app (i.e., severe visual impairment) then we would like to hear from you. At this time, the app is only available for Android phones. With WiFi access, you will not need to use any of your mobile data. If you do not have WiFi access, we estimate that only 1MB of data usage would be needed to participate. You can contact the lab via phone to ask about the Safer Steps study 613-562-5800 ext 3458 (please leave a message and we will call you back) or you can email us at dtlab@uottawa.ca.',
